ISO9jaBet - Match Prediction & Betting Platform

Project Overview

ISO9jaBet is a football prediction platform where users can predict matches and win real cash without depositing any money. The system integrates a Live Score API to fetch daily matches, display odds, and provide a countdown timer for each match.

Users can predict two matches at a time. If their predictions are correct, they win ₦5,000 per match, which is automatically credited to their balance. If a user loses a prediction, ₦2,000 is deducted from their balance.

To make the game more engaging, a Random Lucky Spin Feature allows users to win bonus cash when they run out of balance, encouraging continuous participation. A VIP Activation System is also included for premium benefits.
